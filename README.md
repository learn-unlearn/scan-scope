### --- Command line tool ---

### Docker

docker run -u ${UID}:${UID} -it -v ./:/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app golang bash

## Run in container

go run main.go

### Objectives

[] Discover active hosts on a local network (ICMP "ping sweep").
[] Scan these hosts (or a specific target) for open TCP ports.
[] Be efficient by scanning multiple hosts/ports concurrently using goroutines.

### Core Features

[] Input: Accept a target IP address, hostname, or a CIDR range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
[] Ping Sweep: Identify which hosts in a range are online.
[] Port Scanning: Check a list of common ports or a user-defined range of ports.
[] Output: Clearly display which hosts are online and which ports are open on them.
[] Concurrency: Use goroutines to make the scan fast.

### Additional [if possible]

[] Service banner grabbing (connecting to an open port and reading the first response).
[] UDP port scanning (much more complex and unreliable).
[] Adjustable timeout and number of concurrent workers.
